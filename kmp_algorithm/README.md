# Description
Searching a needle in haystack. Alot of places we are required to search for a given word in a long string. KMP algorithm does that in linear time complexity.
Wikipedia has a nice explanation of the algoritm. This is just the c++ code conversion of the psudocode provided in the explanation.

# Complexity
Extra Space: O(`w`)

Time: O(`n+w`)

here `n` is the size of search space and `w` is the size of search text
