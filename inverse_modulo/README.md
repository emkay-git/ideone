# Problem Statement
Write a code calculate the inverse modulo of an integer.

# Solution
Inverse modulo of a number is the number raised to `mod-2` power, where `mod` is number w.r.t. which we have to take the inverse.
Hence writing an efficient exponentiation function is enough.

# Complexity
Fast exponentiation can be done in `O(log(e))` where `e` is the exponent. It uses the binary expansion of the exponent.
